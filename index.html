            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                We begin by looking at the overall recovery of India's tourism sector. The plots below show how key indicators have bounced back from the significant drops seen in 2020 and 2021.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-10 mb-4">Foreign and Outbound Travel is Rebounding</h3>
            <p>The first chart compares the number of foreign tourists visiting India (FTAs) with the number of Indian citizens traveling abroad (INDs). While the volumes are on different scales, both show a clear upward trend, with outbound travel in 2023 surpassing pre-pandemic levels.</p>

                <p>âœ… <strong>Indian Nationals' Departures (INDs)</strong> recovered fully, reaching <strong>27.88 million</strong> in 2023, slightly above the 2019 number of 26.92 million.</p>

            <p>The next chart reveals an even more impressive story: the explosive growth of domestic tourism. While international travel was restricted, Indians explored their own country, and this trend has continued to grow dramatically.</p>
            <img class="my-8 rounded-xl shadow-md transform hover:scale-102" src="Domestic_Tourism_Recovery_Plot.png" alt="Domestic Tourism Recovery Plot">

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-10 mb-4">Foreign Exchange Earnings are Back on Track</h3>
            <p>Finally, we look at the financial side of the recovery. This plot shows that the foreign exchange earnings from tourism have also made a strong comeback.</p>
            <img class="my-8 rounded-xl shadow-md transform hover:scale-102" src="FEEs_Recovery_Plot.png" alt="Foreign Exchange Earnings Recovery Plot">

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-10 mb-4">The Big Picture: A Snapshot of Recovery</h3>
            <p>This final line chart in the recovery section provides a summary of the recovery trajectory for all key metrics, with 2019 serving as the 100% benchmark. It clearly visualizes the speed and extent of the recovery for each segment of the tourism industry.</p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                With a clear understanding of the recovery, letâ€™s explore the profile of the inbound tourist in 2023. What are their motivations, demographics and travel preferences?
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-10 mb-4">Purpose of Visit: Leisure and Diaspora Lead the Way</h3>

            <img class="my-8 rounded-xl shadow-md transform hover:scale-102" src="FTAs_by_Purpose_Pie_Chart.png" alt="FTAs by Purpose Pie Chart">
            <div class="space-y-3">
                <p>âœ… <strong>Leisure and Holiday</strong> is the top reason for visits, making up nearly half of all arrivals.</p>

            </div>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-10 mb-4">Age & Gender: A Balanced Demographic</h3>
            <p>The charts below provide a snapshot of the age and gender distribution of foreign tourists. We can see that India attracts a broad demographic, with a slightly male-dominant but overall balanced gender split.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-10 mb-4">How Do They Travel?</h3>
            <p>The mode of travel is clearly dominated by air transport, reflecting the long distances for many international visitors.</p>
            <img class="my-8 rounded-xl shadow-md transform hover:scale-102" src="FTAs_by_Mode_Pie_Chart.png" alt="FTAs by Mode Pie Chart">
            <p>âœ… A vast majority of FTAs, <span class="highlight">79.4%</span>, arrived by air. However, a significant portion, <span class="highlight">20.1%</span>, entered via land routes, largely comprising tourists from neighboring countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-700 border-b-2 border-gray-200 pb-4 mb-6">Part 3: The Domestic Powerhouse & Monumental Appeal</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                This final section highlights the incredible scale of domestic tourism and provides an interesting look at where both local and international visitors choose to go.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-10 mb-4">Domestic vs. Foreign Visits: A Tale of Two Scales</h3>
            <p>This plot immediately reveals the immense size of the domestic tourism market. Domestic visits dwarf foreign visits, indicating the importance of local travelers to India's tourism economy.</p>
            <img class="my-8 rounded-xl shadow-md transform hover:scale-102" src="Domestic_vs_Foreign_Visits_Pie_Chart.png" alt="Domestic vs Foreign Visits Pie Chart">
            <p>âœ… Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) accounted for an astounding <strong>2.5 billion</strong> visits, while Foreign Tourist Visits (FTVs) stood at <strong>19.25 million</strong>. The domestic market is the undisputed driver of tourism volume in India.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-10 mb-4">Top Destinations: Different Strokes for Different Folks</h3>
            <p>While some states attract both domestic and foreign tourists, the top-ranked destinations show a clear difference in preferences. The next two charts show which states are leading in each category.</p>

            <p>âœ… Foreign tourists tend to favor states with major international hubs and a rich blend of history and culture, such as <strong>Maharashtra</strong>, <strong>Gujarat</strong> and <strong>West Bengal</strong>.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-10 mb-4">The Monumental Draw</h3>
            <p>This final plot is one of the most interesting. It compares the number of domestic and foreign visitors to India's most iconic monuments. It challenges the common perception that these sites are primarily for international tourists.</p>
            <img class="my-8 rounded-xl shadow-md transform hover:scale-102" src="Monument_Visitors_Bar_Chart.png" alt="Monument Visitors Bar Chart">
            <p>âœ… The <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> remains the top draw for both foreign and domestic visitors.</p>
            <p>âœ… However, monuments like the <strong>Sun Temple in Konark</strong> and <strong>Qutub Minar</strong> attract significantly more domestic visitors than foreign ones, reinforcing the idea that India's heritage is a major attraction for its own citizens.</p>
